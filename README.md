# Fanior
Welcome to my online game for bachelors project.
Fanior is casual action multiplayer game.
There are currently no running servers where you could play this game (hopefully this will change in the future).
## Rules
You are a hero fighting other evil oponents trying to stay alive for as long as you can while defeating others.
With every kill you gain points - when you reach certain amount of points, you can upgrade you character, or ignore it to wait for a greater upgrade of your weapon or to gain new ability.
You start with basic weapon, which you can further upgrade. There are countless combinations of weapons, abilities and upgrades - feel free to experiment to find the strongest combination!

My name is VojtÄ›ch Linhart. I'm living in the Czech Republic (small state in the middle of Europe) and I currently study Technical University of Liberec, which I'll hopefully finish soon - this game should help it ;)
I love playing PC games, so I decided to created my own.
