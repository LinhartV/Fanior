With every kill you gain points - when you reach certain amount of points, you can upgrade you character, or ignore it to wait for a greater upgrade of your weapon or to gain new ability.
You start with basic weapon, which you can further upgrade. There are countless combinations of weapons, abilities and upgrades - feel free to experiment to find the strongest combination!

My name is VojtÄ›ch Linhart. I'm living in the Czech Republic (small state in the middle of Europe) and I currently study Technical University of Liberec, which I'll hopefully finish soon - this game should help it ;)
I love playing PC games, so I decided to created my own.
